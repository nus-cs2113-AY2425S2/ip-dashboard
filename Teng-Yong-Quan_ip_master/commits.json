User can store multiple attributes within a Task object and\nthe attributes are only accessible using the Task object\u0027s interface.\n\nLet\u0027s create class Task and construct attributes getters and setters\nand other relevant methods for the class Task.\n\nThis replaces the usage of the String to represent the task and the\nTask list (array) is used instead of a String array and allows user to\ninteract the objects via different methods.\n\nReplace method processForThreeSeconds() to processForOneSecond()\n\nIt is taking slightly long before the user can enter the next command.\nSome user may be impatient and accidentally keys in command while the\nchatbot Yq is processing an action.

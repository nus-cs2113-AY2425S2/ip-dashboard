User can store multiple attributes within a Task object and\nthe attributes are only accessible using the Task object\u0027s interface.\n\nLet\u0027s create class Task and construct attributes getters and setters\nand other relevant methods for the class Task.\n\nThis replaces the usage of the String to represent the task and the\nTask list (array) is used instead of a String array and allows user to\ninteract the objects via different methods.\n\nReplace method processForThreeSeconds() to processForOneSecond()\n\nIt is taking slightly long before the user can enter the next command.\nSome user may be impatient and accidentally keys in command while the\nchatbot Yq is processing an action. This could trigger error and bring\ninconvenience to the user.\n\nReduce 3-seconds delay to a 1-second delay.\n\nThis reduces the waiting time of the user while giving more realism as\nprogram requires time to process an action or command input by the user.\n\nCreate methods printList(), addTask(), markTask() and unmarkTask()\n\nBy compiling the codes into different methods, it is more readable,\ncleaner and user-friendly as requested to display task list contents,\nadd task into the task list, mark task as done and mark task as not\ndone. Try and catch exceptions are added in markTask() and unmarkTask()\nto prevent invalid input number by the user as it involves the user\u0027s\ninput to extract the Task with their corresponding position from the\nTask list.\n\nMake each action or command by the user as a method.\n\nMore methods may be implemented in the future and certain methods would\nrequire some sort of output such as an Array (Task List).

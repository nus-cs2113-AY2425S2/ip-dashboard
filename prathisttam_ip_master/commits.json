Additionally, deeply nested conditional logic in\nstartTaskManagement reduces readability.\n\nLet\u0027s introduce three task types:\n- ToDo: Simple tasks without a deadline.\n- Deadline: Tasks with a specific due date.\n- Event: Tasks that occur within a specific time range.\n\nTo improve code clarity, extract handleMark and handleUnmark methods\nfrom startTaskManagement, reducing nested conditionals.\n\nUsing inheritance improves code organization and allows polymorphic\nhandling of tasks and enhances usability by providing clear distinctions\nbetween task types.\n","tags":["Level-4","A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":154,"deletions":30}}},{"hash":"dda8e690b38c10939421280124ccee6e2599717a","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Refactor task creation: Remove magic numbers and redundant prints","messageBody":"","tags":["A-CodeQuality-v1.2"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":24,"deletions":13}}}]},{"date":"2025-02-14","commitResults":[{"hash":"c77fcfea982e3119cf175a1d21f43903330e8fda","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Chatbot error handling: prevent crashes and improve user feedback","messageBody":"Error handling relies solely on printing messages, making it\ninconsistent and difficult to manage.
